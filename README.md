A website for my tarot reading practice

## about this website

This webpage is inspired by my hatred of scrolling. The infinite scroll is one of the most disastrous mistakes in the history of UI. Looking at a website should not feel like falling down an endless rabbit hole. A website, like a story, should have a clear beginning, middle and end. You should arrive, do what you came to do, and get on with your life.

These days even websites without infinite scroll still have too much scroll. I wanted to fight that trend by designing a website that gives me everything I need right away. I wanted a design that immediately shows the user everything they need to see and nothing more, to put them in a state of clearheaded decisiveness. Facebook and Twitter are painstakingly engineered to do the exact opposite.

I accomplished this goal by putting all the content into modals. The modal the perfect metaphor for attention as such: the thing you're supposed to pay attentioned to, against the shadowed background of everything else. In order for it to be genuine attention, the background has to still be there. Attention is the lack of distraction, but attention is also not tunnel-vision or hyperfocus. Like ocular vision, it is stereoscopic. It must define itself against a backdrop, otherwise it gets lost.

There are two types of website visitors: the ones who have visited before and the ones who have not. My website assumes the latter. It begins with a "splash modal" that draws the visitor to the "about modal". My product is a weird product, and I assume that people will be skeptical. My job is to immediately address their skepticism, hence shepherding them to the FAQ, which then gives them the opportunity to schedule a session. Always be ready to take people's money at the moment they feel like giving it to you.

There is also the opportunity to X out of the splash modal - which makes appear, with a neat little card-flip transition, the main menu. Remember those? Remember when you opened up a computer program and there was just a menu, instead of a whole galaxy of widgets all competing for your gaze? The four colors of the menu are all Bootstrap builtins. I decided that they're a nice homage to the bold Belle-Epoque tones of the classic Waite-Smith Tarot deck that serves my website's visual and typographical inspiration.

The font is called "Averia Serif Libre" and I love it! I'm going to use it all the time now.

There is still plenty to do. Aside from writing content for the About modal, I need to put in some sort of nice-looking functionality on the Schedule modal and figure out a CMS solution for blog. I also just need to add a little more polish and sand away a few rough edges. But aside from that, this website is just about ready for deployment.
