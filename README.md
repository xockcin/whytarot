# whytarot
A website for my tarot reading practice

To-Do:
- Add menu to index page
    - Menu items: Schedule a Session; About; Blog; Contact.
    - Menu is hidden when page first loads; appears when user Xes out of splash modal.
    - Menu appears with a right-to-left flipping animation, suggestive of a card.
    - Each menu item does something when you mouse over it.
